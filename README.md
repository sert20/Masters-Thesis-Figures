# Masters-Thesis-Figures
Complete set of figures for Sergio Turrado's Master's Thesis "Numerical modeling of the atmosphere of exoplanet Trappist-1 e" within the Master in Astrophysics at Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

The folder "Figures" contains the complete postprocessed ROCKE-3D output of the simulated cases in the Thesis.
In particular, those cases named with the label "900_Wm-2" are the ones intended to reproduce the THAI collaboration results,
while the ones labelled "881_Wm-2" are meant to compare the effects of a lower instellation on the global climate.

The cases therein are further explained in the complete text of the Master's Thesis, and this repository does not make sense on its own.
Instead, it is intended to serve as support material to the Thesis, to facilitate reading and providing the reader with complete information about each simulated case.
